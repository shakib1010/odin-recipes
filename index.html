      <p>
        A tasty Persian salad which originated in the town of Shiraz in Southern
        Iran. Almost always served as a side dish, it's crunchy, bright,
        refreshing with a mild citrus-flavored dressing, and is served
        year-round.

        <h2>Greek Spinach Rice (Spanakorizo)</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        With tons of fresh herb flavor, this Greek spinach rice is a simple dish
        with complex flavors. Serve as a side dish with grilled chicken, lamb,
        or stew, or by itself as a vegetarian main course. The fresh squeeze of
        lemon juice and feta crumble are critical to the taste â€” don't leave
        them out!

        <h2>Spring Orzo Risotto</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        I thought I had Arborio rice but I obviously did not. Orzo pasta makes a
        delightful risotto with help from spring veggies like asparagus and
        peas. For service, garnish with some freshly grated Grana Padano cheese
        and chopped parsley.
